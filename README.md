# EA Grails Technical Test

### Task

* The task is implement a website that allows the user to login to search the Github repoistories.
* You have 4 hours to complete the test.
* Please finish all the items outlined in the Requirements section first, then try to tackle items in the Nice to Haves section if you have time.
* If you cannot finish the test, please explain why as we are reasonable and realize people have time constraints.

### Setup

* You can find the design under the design folder
* You would need Grails 2.1.4 to run the application

### Requirements

* We expect you to leverage the powers of Grails plugins to install an authentication plugin. Eg spring-security-plugin
* The login form should have server side validation
* All pages should be gated by the login page if the user is not login.
* You are free to use any http client to call out to Github's API
* Have a search field that allows searching for a GitHub user's repositories. See http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-user-repositories for more info. Call the following API (where USER_NAME is the value typed into the search field):
```
https://api.github.com/users/USER_NAME/repos
```
* Once the search is clicked, the results should show a list of that user's public repositories with each item in a "name/number of watchers" format.
* The results should be in json format for the view to consume
* Use h2 as the datasource
* It's not a requirement to style the pages
* We expect to have unit test code coverage of your code

### Nice to Haves

* When a result is clicked, display an alert box with the repository's ID and the created_at time.
* Use AngularJS to display the repositories results
* Extended functionalities where you see fit.

### Deliverables

* Please fork this project on GitHub and add your code to the forked project.
* Update the README file to include the time you spent and anything else you wish to convey.
* Send the link to your forked GitHub project to your recruiter.

*Good luck!**

### Comments

The total time to complete the projects was over 4 hours. The reason for this is that I currently only have my old 2009 laptop available which is incredibly sluggish for Java development. Especially startup, configuration changes and tests are painfully slow. The actual time spent on development was far less than that. Having completed the main requirements, I didn't want to spend more time on the Nice To Haves, although it probably would not have taken much longer.
